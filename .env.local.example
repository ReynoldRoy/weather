# Firebase Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local (create it if it doesn't exist) in the root of your project.
# Then, fill in your Firebase project's specific credentials.
# You can find these values in your Firebase project console:
# 1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
# 2. Select your project.
# 3. Click on "Project settings" (the gear icon near "Project Overview" in the left sidebar).
# 4. In the "General" tab, scroll down to the "Your apps" section.
# 5. If you haven't registered your web app yet:
#    - Click "Add app" and choose the web icon (</>).
#    - Follow the on-screen instructions to register your app.
#    - During or after registration, Firebase will show you a `firebaseConfig` object.
# 6. If your app is already registered:
#    - Click on its name or look for the "SDK setup and configuration" section.
#    - Choose the "Config" option (radio button or similar) to view the `firebaseConfig` object.
#
# Use the values from that `firebaseConfig` object to fill in the variables below.
# IMPORTANT: After creating or modifying .env.local, you MUST restart your Next.js development server
# (e.g., stop it with Ctrl+C in the terminal, then run 'npm run dev' or 'yarn dev' again).

# Required Firebase variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY_HERE"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID_HERE"

# Optional Firebase variables (provide if you use these services, otherwise can be left blank or commented out):
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET_HERE"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID_HERE"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID_HERE"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID_HERE" # For Google Analytics for Firebase

# --- Example of how they might look (DO NOT USE THESE VALUES) ---
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSy*******************"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project-id.firebaseapp.com"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project-id.appspot.com"

# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:123456789012:web:abcdef1234567890abcdef"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-ABCDEFGHIJ"

# Note: The WeatherAPI key is currently managed in src/lib/config.ts.
# If you were to move it to environment variables, it would look like this:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHERAPI_COM_API_KEY="YOUR_WEATHERAPI_COM_API_KEY_HERE"
